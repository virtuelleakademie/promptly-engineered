If you already have Python installed, you can skip these steps.\n\nIf you want to follow a video tutorial, this is a really good introduction on how to install Python and set up a local development environment using VSCode: \n\n\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2cwvpJSBX4 >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to follow a written tutorial, here are the steps to getting Python and VSCode set up on your computer:\n\n# Install Python\n\n## Windows\nIf you are using Windows, you can either install Python from the Microsoft Store or from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to install either the latest version (3.13) or version 3.12.7.\n\n## MacOS\nIf you are using MacOS, you can install Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), either the latest version (3.13)or version 3.12.7.\n\nHowever, I recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Python. The following is a good guide to installing Python with Homebrew: [Brew Install Python](https://mac.install.guide/python/index.html).\n\n## Linux\nIf you are using Linux, you can install Python using the package manager for your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install Python using `sudo apt install python3`.\n\n## Alternative: \n\nAn alternative way to install Python on all platforms is to use [Miniforge](https://conda-forge.org/download/). This is miniforge is the community (conda-forge) driven minimalistic conda installer. It can manage Python versions and dependencies in isolated environments. We will not be using `conda` to manage environments in this workshop, but will use `venv` and `pip` instead.\n\n\n\n# Install VSCode\n\nNext, you will need to install VSCode. You can download it from the [VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).\n\nThe following is a comprehensive guide to setting up VSCode for Python: [VSCode Python Tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial).\n\n\n# Create a workspace\nWe will create a test workspace in VSCode. First, create a directory on your computer to store the workspace. Then, open VSCode and select the option to open the folder. Once you have opened the folder in VSCode, you are in a workspace. \n\n![](../../assets/images/vscode-workspace.png)\n\n# Set up a Python environment\n\nUse the following steps to set up a Python environment in VSCode.\n\n(@) Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux, Cmd+Shift+P on MacOS)\n(@) Select `Python: Create Environment`\n(@) Select `venv`\n\n![](../../assets/images/vscode-venv.png)\n\n\n(@) Select the Python version you installed earlier (3.13 or 3.12.7)\n\n(@) Open the Terminal in VSCode by selecting `Terminal` > `New Terminal`\n\nRun the following commands to verify that the Python version is correct:\n\n```bash\nwhich python   \n```\n\n\n\n\n```{bash}\npython --version\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n![](../../assets/images/vscode-python-version.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n# Install stuff\n\n1) Install VSCode \n2) Install Python\n3) Work in a local environment\n   1) Set up a local environment from VSCode [{{< bi link >}} link](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)\n\n",
