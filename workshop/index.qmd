In this workshop, we will cover the following topics:

- Using the OpenAI API
- Creating an Anki flashcard generator using the OpenAI API

We will work with the GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4o models from OpenAI. Note that we could also use local models, but this would require a bit more setup and is outside the scope of this workshop.

The focus of this workshop is on using the OpenAI API, so we will only discuss Python in passing. I do recommend that you install an AI coding assistant, such as Github Copilot. For beginners, this will help to get you started with Python. 


The workshop is structured as follows:

- Introduction
- Python setup
- VSCode setup
- Verify OpenAI
- Test structured output
