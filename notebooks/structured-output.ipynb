    "# Structured Output\n",
    "\n",
    "A very useful feature of OpenAI's API is the ability to return structured data. This is useful for a variety of reasons, but one of the most common is to return a JSON object.\n",
    "Here is the official [OpenAI documentation for structured output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI's API can return responses in structured formats like JSON, making it easier to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parse and process responses programmatically\n",
    "- Ensure consistent output formats\n",
    "- Integrate with existing systems and databases\n",
    "\n",
    "When using structured output, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define specific JSON schemas for your responses\n",
    "2. Get predictable data structures instead of free-form text\n",
    "3. Reduce the need for additional parsing/processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Common use cases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extracting specific fields from text\n",
    "- Converting unstructured data into structured formats\n",
    "- Creating standardized API responses\n",
    "- Building data pipelines with LLM outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Put very simply, the difference between structured and unstructured output is illustrated by the following example: Imagine you want to know the current weather in a city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unstructured output:** The response is a free-form text response.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"The current weather in Bern is 8 degrees Celsius with partly cloudy skies.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "> The weather in Bern is 10° with rain.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Structured output:** The response is a JSON object with the weather information.\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\"city\": \"Bern\", \n",
    "\"temperature\": 8, \n",
    "\"scale\": \"Celsius\",\n",
    "\"condition\": \"partly cloudy\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefit of structured output is that it is easier to parse and process programmatically. A further advantage is that we can use a data validation library like Pydantic to ensure that the response is in the expected format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this feature, we first need to install the `pydantic` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pydantic\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can define a Pydantic model to describe the expected structure of the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
    "\n",
    "class Weather(BaseModel):\n",
    "    city: str\n",
    "    temperature: float\n",
    "    scale: str\n",
    "    condition: str\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use this object as the `response_format` parameter in the `openai.ChatCompletion.create` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Extracting facts from text\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use structured output. Since a pre-trained model is not actually able to provide weather information without calling a weather API, we will use a prompt that asks the model to give us some facts contained in a text about a composer. For example, we want to extract the composer's name, the year of birth and death, and the country of origin, the genre of music they worked in, and some key works.\n"

    "Éric Alfred Leslie Satie (1866–1925) was a French composer and pianist known for his eccentric personality and groundbreaking contributions to music. Often associated with the Parisian avant-garde, Satie coined the term “furniture music” (musique d’ameublement) to describe background music intended to blend into the environment, an early precursor to ambient music. He is perhaps best known for his piano compositions, particularly the Gymnopédies and Gnossiennes, which are characterized by their simplicity, haunting melodies, and innovative use of harmony. Satie’s collaborations with artists like Claude Debussy, Pablo Picasso, and Jean Cocteau established him as a central figure in early 20th-century modernism. Despite his whimsical demeanor, he significantly influenced composers such as John Cage and minimalists of the mid-20th century.\n",
