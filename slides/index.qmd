### What is a journal club?

A journal club is a group activity where researchers meet to critically discuss and analyze scientific papers from their field.

- Promotes deep understanding of research methods and findings
- Promotes critical thinking and constructive critique
- Builds collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Identifies new research directions and open questions


## Problems with large groups

- Traditional "brainstorming" in large groups is ineffective
- Room dynamics lead to limited participation
- Stronger voices dominate discussions
- Many participants remain silent
- Ideas often go unexpressed or underdeveloped

## Optimal scientific collaboration

- @yanaiItTakesTwo2024 argue that two-person collaborations represent the optimal format for creative scientific discussions and idea development
- They draw on insights from improvisational theater and evolutionary psychology
- Through paired discussions, scientists can create a trusting environment
- This environment encourages free exploration of ideas
- It avoids the social complexities and participation barriers of larger group discussions


## Core concept

LLMs can

- provide always-available thinking partners for immediate feedback and alternative perspectives
- can embody the "Yes, and" principle, building on ideas without criticism
- remove social anxiety, enabling creative exploration of early ideas
- help structure ideas into clearer linear thinking
- can make assumptions explicitand identify reasoning flaws through questioning
- **complement** human collaboration by providing a safe space for initial idea development
